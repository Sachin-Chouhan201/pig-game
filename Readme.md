# Pig Game

Pig Game is a two-player dice game where players take turns to roll a single die as many times as they wish, adding the result to their score. If a player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated in that turn and it becomes the next player's turn. The first player to reach a specified winning score wins the game.
